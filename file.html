                <p>I come from a vibrant background, with roots in Honduras that shape my identity and values. Growing up, my parents instilled in me the importance of hard work and perseverance, which has influenced my approach to life and my ambitions. Soccer has always been a passion of mine, not just as a sport but as a way to connect with my heritage and community. I also enjoy running and hiking, activities that keep me physically active and allow me to appreciate the beauty of nature.</p>
                <p>As I navigate my educational journey, one of my main goals is to graduate from college with a degree in Information Technology. I chose this major because it fascinates me to understand how technology works, especially the ability to code and create websites. The prospect of working remotely is particularly appealing, as it offers flexibility and the chance to collaborate with people from around the world. I believe that mastering these skills will open doors to exciting opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I keep myself busy with various activities. I enjoy training kids in soccer, sharing my passion and skills with the next generation. Going to the gym helps me stay in shape and maintain my energy levels for all my pursuits. I also work and run a custom t-shirt business, which allows me to express my creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. Balancing these commitments is challenging but rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds as I work towards my goals.
